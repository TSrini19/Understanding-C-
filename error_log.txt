This file consists of all the errors that I made during my learning. 
This file can be used as a tool to be aware of mistakes that you can experience while you code.

My Mistakes
============
1) Never use 'using namespace std;'. This will import all the functions inside std. 
Instead follow the conventions such as std::cout, std::cin to save memory and to optimize your code. 

2) Compound operations cannot be performed during std::cout. They have to be defined and executed in a separate line. 

3) Always ensure that each statement is ended with a ';'. This will throw error during compilation.  

4) While using pointers, '*' is used for defining a pointer that point to a particular object. To access the value stored at a particular memory
location, we use the '&' operator. To fetch an value stored at a particular memory address, we dereference the pointer using '*'.

5) Always follow indentations to improve readability of your code.

6) To define conditions inside if statements use '()'.  

7) While initializing a for loop, either define the datatype of the variable inside the loop or at the entry point of the program.

8) While using while loop, never forget to add incremental/decremental statements inside the loop. Failure to do will create an infinite loop if the condition
inside while loop is evaluated as true. 

9) Always end the while statement in do while loop using a ';'. This will throw error during compilation.
