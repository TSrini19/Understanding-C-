This file consists of all the errors that I made during my learning. 
This file can be used as a tool to be aware of mistakes that you can experience while you code.

My Mistakes
============
1) Never use 'using namespace std;'. This will import all the functions inside std. 
Instead follow the conventions such as std::cout, std::cin to save memory and to optimize your code. 

2) compound operations cannot be performed during std::cout. They have to be defined and executed as a separate line.
