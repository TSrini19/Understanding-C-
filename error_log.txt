This file consists of all the errors that I made during my learning. 
This file can be used as a tool to be aware of mistakes that you can experience while you code.

My Mistakes
============
1) Never use 'using namespace std;'. This will import all the functions inside std. 
Instead follow the conventions such as std::cout, std::cin to save memory and to optimize your code. 

2) Compound operations cannot be performed during std::cout. They have to be defined and executed in a separate line. 

3) Always ensure that each statement is ended with a ';'. This will throw error during compilation.  

4) While using pointers, '*' is used for defining a pointer that point to a particular object. To access the value stored at a particular memory
location, we use the '&' operator. To fetch an value stored at a particular memory address, we dereference the pointer using '*'.

5) Always follow indentations to improve readability of your code.

6) To define conditions inside if statements use '()'.
